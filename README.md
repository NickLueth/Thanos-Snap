**About the script**:<br>
Thanos snap is a python script that tracks who gets killed when Thanos snaps his fingers and half of the population dies. All results are saved to two text files: alive.txt, dead.txt. These files are loaded into the script everytime time it is run. One downfall of this script is that is will overtime get slower and slower as the number of names you add increases. 

**Next Goal**<br>
Implement a menu that allows you to check results for one or more people, view all alive entries, view all dead entries, view all entries, and quit.
MAIN MENU:
1. Check name(s)
2. View known living
3. View known dead
4. View all known
5. Quit

**End Goal**:<br>
My goal is to put this on a web server and make a fancy GUI that feeds input into the script from people on the internet.
