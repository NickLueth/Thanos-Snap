**About the script**:<br>
Thanos snap is a python script that tracks who gets killed when Thanos snaps his fingers and half of the population dies. All results are saved to two text files: alive.txt, dead.txt. These files are loaded into the script everytime time it is run. One downfall of this script is that is will overtime get slower and slower as the number of names you add increases. 

**Goal**:<br>
My goal is to put this on a web server and make a fancy GUI that feeds input into the script from people on the internet.
